PART 2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
### What It Is

A browser extension and web dashboard for intentional content consumption. Users save links to read later, then receive them randomly one at a time with AI-generated summaries.

### üöÄ PRODUCTIVITY MODE

**What It Does**

- User selects distracting sites to block (Reddit, YouTube, etc.)
- Clicking any link on blocked sites intercepts navigation
- Shows "Saved for later" interstitial page
- Link automatically saved to queue for later

**User Controls**

- Quick toggle to temporarily bypass blocking
- Add/remove sites from block list anytime
- Disable productivity mode entirely if needed

**Goal**
Forces delayed consumption instead of instant gratification. You still see the content, just at a better time.

### üé® FUN MODE

**What It Does**

- Manual bookmarking via extension icon
- Normal browsing behavior, no blocking
- Click the icon on any page to save it

**Use Case**
For when you're browsing intentionally but still want to save things for later.

### üé∞ RANDOM DELIVERY (Core Mechanic)

**Extension Popup Experience**

- Shows ONE random link from your queue
- Includes one-sentence AI summary

    - **Accept** ‚Üí Opens link and removes from queue
    - **Skip** ‚Üí Shows another random link (current one stays in queue)
    - **Delete** ‚Üí Removes link permanently
- Quick link to "Search queue on dashboard ‚Üí" for finding specific items

**Why Random?**
