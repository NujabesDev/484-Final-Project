PART 1 : ELEVATOR PITCH
### The Problem We're Solving

We all do it - save Reddit posts, YouTube videos, and articles to read later. But those lists become digital graveyards. They grow endlessly, we never look at them, and the content loses relevance. The friction is too high: hundreds of items, no context about what each link was, and complete paralysis from too many choices.

### Our Solution

We're building a browser extension that intercepts this behavior. It has two modes: productivity mode auto-saves links when you're supposed to be working (and blocks the navigation), while fun mode lets you manually bookmark things. But here's the twist - instead of showing users their entire queue, **we show ONE random link at a time**.

### ðŸŽ² The Key Innovation: Random Delivery

When you open the extension or get a notification, you see a single item with a one-sentence AI summary. Three choices: accept and read it now, skip to see another random one, or delete it. No overwhelming lists, no choice paralysis - just one thing to decide on.

### Why This Actually Works

The randomization creates serendipity. That article you saved three weeks ago resurfaces when you're actually in the mood to read. The AI summary gives just enough context to decide without spoiling the content. It's curated consumption on your own terms.

### What Makes This Different

- **Not just a bookmark manager** - we intercept browsing to enforce intentional consumption
- **Not just a reading list** - random delivery + AI summaries turn saved content into a feed you actually want to check
- **Not just a blocker** - it saves what you wanted for a better time instead of saying "no"

### TL;DR

We're turning "read it later" into "read it when it matters" through randomization and context. Modern tech stack, achievable scope, and something we'd actually use ourselves.
