## üí° Ideas To Add

**Auth & Onboarding**

- Google OAuth sign-in (currently just says "Supabase Auth" with no specifics)

**Content Handling**

- Platform-specific handlers (YouTube API for video descriptions, Reddit-specific scraping for threads)
- Content script injection timing fix: `run_at: "document_start"` in manifest

**Queue Management**

- Tags/categories system (work, fun, learn, etc.) for filtering random delivery
- "Read Later Today" priority/pinned queue for urgent links
- Link expiration/auto-archive after 6 months
- Separate "mark as read" status vs permanent delete

**Platform Clarity**

- Explicitly document: Desktop extension only (Chrome/Firefox on Windows/Mac/Linux)

---

## üéØ The Core Idea

**What We're Building**
Browser extension that saves links for later, then shows you ONE random link at a time with an AI summary

**Two Modes**

- **Productivity Mode**: Blocks distracting sites, auto-saves links
- **Fun Mode**: Manual bookmark button

**The Magic**
Random delivery + AI summaries = actually reading saved stuff instead of hoarding

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Extension**: React + Vite + shadcn/ui + webextension-polyfill

**Backend**: Supabase (Database + Auth + Edge Functions)

**Website**: React + Vite + shadcn/ui (shared components!)

**AI**: Gemini API (free tier, opt-in only)

## üìå PROJECT SCOPE SUMMARY

### Must-Have (Core Features) ‚úÖ

- Dual-mode operation (Productivity + Fun)
- Click interception and link saving
- Random one-at-a-time delivery
- AI-generated summaries (opt-in)

### Why This Project Is Cool

We're combining browser extension APIs, content script injection, modern React frontend (extension + website with shared components!), backend infrastructure, LLM integration, real-time sync, and privacy-conscious data handling. It's solving a real behavior problem that we all have, and it's something we'd actually want to use after we build it.
